# This file has been automatically generated.
# Instead of changing it, create a file called import_helper.py
# and put there a class called ImportHelper(object) in it.
#
# This class will be specially casted so that instead of extending object,
# it will actually extend the class BasicImportHelper()
#
# That means you just have to overload the methods you want to
# change, leaving the other ones inteact.
#
# Something that you might want to do is use transactions, for example.
#
# Also, don't forget to add the necessary Django imports.
#
# This file was generated with the following command:
# manage.py dumpscript accounts
#
# to restore it, run
# manage.py runscript module_name.this_script_name
#
# example: if manage.py is at ./manage.py
# and the script is at ./some_folder/some_script.py
# you must make sure ./some_folder/__init__.py exists
# and run  ./manage.py runscript some_folder.some_script
